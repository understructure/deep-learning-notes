# Deep Learning Notes

These are my notes on Deep Learning.  It's a work in progress, so it might look like a hot mess, but that's ok.



### TensorFlow

[Getting Started With TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started)

### TensorBoard

* [TensorBoard: Graph Visualization](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/graph_viz) note:  this is *really* where you should start with this stuff when you try to put it into practice
* [Hands-On TensorBoard (TensorFlow Dev Summit 2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBbEDRsCmv4&t=16s)
* [TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard)



### Convolutional Neural Networks


* [A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ol7ZB0MmU)
* [Tensorflow and deep learning - without a PhD by Martin GÃ¶rner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2nnJ4g6N0&feature=youtu.be&t=3580) (note: starts at point of Convolutional NNs)
* [Siraj Raval - Convolutional Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTr3n7uBIuE)
  * [Jupyter Notebook for video](https://github.com/llSourcell/Convolutional_neural_network/blob/master/convolutional_network_tutorial.ipynb)
