They have *synapses*, which take the neurons and multiply them by some given weight, to result in another neuron (a *perceptron*). This neuron adds together all the outputs of the previous synapses + neurons and applies an  *activation function* that acts upon them to normalize the output. These neurons are then used as the next round of input.  \n",
